# Course Management System

## Introduction
* An honest attempt to build a course management system
* CMS will consist of a client, server and a message broker
* 3 client interfaces:
    * Student
    * Instructor
    * Admin
* Server - REST API (Spring)
* On demand communication b/w client & server - HTTP/TCP
* Real time communication - JMS (Kafka/RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ)
